Sleep Quality Classification with Somnox & Smartwatch Data

This project explores how wearable device data collected via the Somnox sleep robot and a smartwatch can be used to classify users‚Äô sleep quality using machine learning models. After identifying the most informative feature: 'Latency to Persistent Sleep'  we trained and compared multiple models (Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost, Neural Networks) within an automated pipeline to determine the best-performing approach for sleep quality classification.

üéØ Goal

To predict Latency to Persistent Sleep based on physiological and behavioral signals, and to evaluate how well machine learning models can classify sleep quality into five levels:
Very Low ¬∑ Low ¬∑ Medium ¬∑ High ¬∑ Very High

üõ†Ô∏è Workflow
	‚Ä¢	Data inspection & cleaning (thresholds for missing/zero values)
	‚Ä¢	Outlier handling with Winsorization
	‚Ä¢	SQ-feature filtering (to prevent leakage)
	‚Ä¢	Feature normalization (StandardScaler)
	‚Ä¢	Target binning into 5 categories
	‚Ä¢	Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
	‚Ä¢	Automated model training & evaluation (switch between algorithms)
	‚Ä¢	SHAP analysis for model interpretability

üîç Models Used
	‚Ä¢	Random Forest
	‚Ä¢	AdaBoost
	‚Ä¢	XGBoost
	‚Ä¢	Neural Networks (baseline MLP)
	‚Ä¢	Automated framework allows easy switching between models to compare performance
	‚Ä¢	Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
	‚Ä¢	Feature importance: SHAP summary plots

‚ö†Ô∏è Dataset Note

Due to limited data size, especially in the test set, classification metrics are unstable:
	‚Ä¢	Test set size: 7 examples
	‚Ä¢	Accuracy: ~29%
	‚Ä¢	Some classes have only 1‚Äì2 samples ‚Üí metrics are not representative

- Random Forest (default + hyperparameter tuned)
- XGBoost (planned)
- Classifier evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Feature importance: SHAP summary plots
